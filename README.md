# Resort-Management-Syetem
The aim of Resort Booking System is to automate the current system used by the resort for booking 
purpose. We aim to demonstrate the use of creating, reading, updating, and deleting MySQL 
operations through this project. At first the rooms are added to the database by the admin. If the 
user has an account, then he should login to his account otherwise create a new account and then 
login using the new account. Each user is identified by his email ID. After logging in to his account 
the user can reserve a room of his/her choice. Then he/she must do the payment to confirm the 
booking through debit/credit card. The admin interface allows to manage the rooms and the users. 
The admin can view all the rooms and which and all rooms are vacant or booked. Admin has the 
privilege to either confirm or reject the booking. He can even add new rooms and remove the 
existing ones. He can also view the details of every user.
